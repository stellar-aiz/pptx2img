# rhodopsin - No more LibreOffice for AI

Convert PPTX slides to PNG or searchable PDF with a standalone CLI or Rust library.

**😎 No Office, LibreOffice, browser, Python, or Node runtime required.**

Early implementation: rendering is approximate, not fully PowerPoint-compatible.

## Quick start

```
rhodopsin <INPUT> [--format png|pdf] [--out PATH] [--width N] [...]
```

Requires Rust and Cargo. Install from this checkout:

```sh
cargo install --path . --locked
rhodopsin slides.pptx
rhodopsin --help
```

Writes `slides.rhodopsin/slide-001.png`, etc., and `manifest.json`.
Use `--out images` to choose a destination; existing directories are never overwritten.

For one PDF per deck, use `rhodopsin slides.pptx --format pdf --out slides.pdf`.
PDF output preserves text and supported vector shapes using the existing rendering
dependencies. Its initial [supported subset](docs/rendering.md#pdf-output) is narrower
than PNG; unsupported PDF features fail explicitly. Existing files are never replaced.

## XLSX to PDF (under development)

`.xlsx` input is accepted by the same CLI and converted to PDF only:

```sh
rhodopsin book.xlsx --format pdf
```

The spreadsheet renderer (`crates/xlsx`) is not connected end to end yet, so every workbook currently stops with a diagnostic instead of a PDF.
See [XLSX input](docs/usage.md#xlsx-input) and [docs/xlsx.md](docs/xlsx.md).

## Fonts and warnings

- Supply missing fonts with `--font-file /path/to/font.ttf` (repeatable).
- Font-family substitution requires `--font-fallback`.
- Individual missing glyphs use available fallback fonts and produce warnings.
  If no font can render a character, conversion fails.
- `--strict` stops on any warning before writing output.

Success returns YAML on stdout; failures return YAML on stderr.
Warnings and rendering diagnostics are retained in the PNG manifest or PDF result
document on stdout.
